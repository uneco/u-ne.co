# Third-party assets

## Apple

The following assets originate from Apple's [iPhone Duo product page](https://www.apple.com/iphone-duo/):

- `public/models/iphone-duo.usdz`: a prepared landscape pose of Apple's model.
- `public/models/iphone-duo.glb`: a converted model with split folding geometry, adjusted materials, and replaceable screen surfaces. Includes textures from Apple's model.
- `public/wallpapers/apple-desert.avif` and `apple-desert-cover.avif`: wallpaper textures from Apple's model.

The original model, textures, product design, and Apple trademarks remain the property of Apple and their respective owners. These assets are excluded from this repository's MIT license. Attribution is not a grant of redistribution or commercial-use rights. Review Apple's applicable terms and obtain any necessary permissions for your intended use. Replace these assets with your own if you need a wholly MIT-licensed distribution.

`AppleCredit` displays the model credit in the demo. The folding sequence was studied from Apple's product demonstration; no frames from that video are included in the final screen artwork.

## Original screen artwork

`home-apps.svg`, `home-cover.svg`, `home-photo.svg`, `tide.svg`, and `ink.svg` are original SVG artwork included under the MIT license. The `home-photo.svg` filename refers to the incoming card slot; its content is a Mastra Factory illustration, not a photograph.

The Factory card is demo artwork requested for this study. Mastra's name is not licensed by this repository, and the artwork does not imply an official announcement or endorsement.

## Dependencies

Third-party software dependencies retain their own licenses. Exact versions are recorded in `package-lock.json`.
